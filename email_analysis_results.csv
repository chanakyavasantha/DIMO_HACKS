",0.99,"This email is most likely phishing as it claims that the recipient's password was changed for their Google account. However, the sender's email address, although appearing to be from Google, is actually from a different domain. This is a common tactic used by phishing scams to trick users into disclosing sensitive information. The email also includes a link to recover the account, which could potentially lead to a fake website used to steal login information. Additionally, the email creates a sense of urgency and prompts the recipient to take immediate action, a common strategy used by phishing scams. The only reason this email does not receive a score of 100 is due to the inclusion of a legitimate Google security link, which could potentially confuse recipients and make them believe the email is genuine. However, based on the other indicators, this email is highly likely to be phishing."

",0.95,"This email contains suspicious language urging you to 'secure your account now' and warning that your account may have been compromised. It also asks you to check activity and visit a suspicious link to confirm your account changes. These are common tactics used by phishing emails to trick users into giving away their personal information. The sender's email appears to be from 'Google' but further investigation shows it is from a no-reply email address. This is a strong indication that this email is a phishing attempt, and we highly recommend not clicking on any links or providing any personal information in response to this email."

",0.05,"This email is likely not phishing for several reasons. First, the sender's email address is a legitimate Google address (no-reply@accounts.google.com). Second, the email addresses the recipient by name and provides useful information about 2-Step Verification, a known security feature offered by Google. Third, the email includes a link to the official Google website for managing 2-Step Verification settings. However, as with all emails, it is important to be cautious and verify the legitimacy of the email by checking the URL of any links before clicking. Based on these factors, the likelihood of this email being phishing is low with a score of 5."

",1.0,"The message is using scare tactics and a sense of urgency to prompt the recipient to click on a link that may lead to a phishing website. The use of a generic sender address (no-reply@accounts.google.com) is also suspicious. In addition, the message does not refer to the recipient by name or include any specific details about the account or changes made to it. These are all common indicators of a phishing attempt, raising the likelihood of the email being a phishing scam to 100 out of 100."
8,sai garikapati <saigarikapati1@gmail.com>,"Hi I would Iike to book a appointment for saloon
",0.8,"The email is marked as phishing with a score of 80 because it contains a request to book a salon appointment, which is a common tactic used by phishing emails to lure users into clicking on malicious links or providing personal information. In addition, the sender's email address does not match the name given in the email, which is another indicator of a possible phishing attempt. However, the email does not contain any suspicious links or attachments, which is why the score is not higher."
