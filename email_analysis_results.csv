The email also uses non-specific language and sends a large amount of unsolicited information. While Google is a legitimate company, the presence of these red flags suggests that the email may not be a legitimate communication from the company. Therefore, it is recommended that caution be exercised and the email not be replied to or any links clicked on."

",0.9,"This email exhibits many common characteristics of a phishing attempt. First, the sender's email address does not match the company name. Additionally, the email is urging the recipient to take immediate action and providing a link for them to follow, which is a common tactic used by phishing emails. The use of the company's name in the email adds a sense of legitimacy, but the urgency of the message combined with the use of a non-official email address raises suspicion. The sender is also encouraging the recipient to check their account activity and secure their account, which is a common ruse used by phishers to trick people into giving away sensitive information. The email also includes a copyright line and the mailing address of the company, which is a common practice among legitimate emails, adding to the perceived legitimacy of the message. However, these details can easily be copied and do not necessarily make the email any more trustworthy. Overall, the numerous red flags in this email suggest a high likelihood of it being a phishing attempt."

",1.0,"The suspicious activity alert and request for account security check is a common tactic used by phishing emails to gain access to personal information. The use of a fake sender email address further confirms the malicious intent of this email. Additionally, the inclusion of a seemingly legitimate Google copyright notice at the end of the email aims to deceive the recipient into thinking the email is legitimate. This email has a high likelihood of being a phishing attempt and caution should be taken."

",0.75,"The email is for a sender with a suspicious email domain 'jekk.com'. The lack of context or personalization in the body of the email also increases the likelihood of phishing. However, it is not a definite indication and further investigation is recommended."
16,James <oic@me.com>,"I cam for my appointment last week and since then all my hair has fallen out, ive kept in a small green plastic bag submerged in peroxide, can you glue it back in strand by strand please? Also how much for the trim and how much weight will I loose?",0.99,"This email is highly likely to be a phishing attempt. The sender's email address is suspicious and does not match their name. The message contains strange and concerning requests, such as gluing hair back onto their head and asking about weight loss. These can be attempts to gather personal information or money from the recipient. The only reason this email does not receive a 100 score is because the sender's name could potentially be legitimate, although there is not enough information to confirm this."

> Hi James,
> I'm sorry to hear about your recent salon experience. As an AI assistant, I am not able to physically assist with your hair restoration request. I recommend reaching out to the salon directly to address your concerns and to discuss any potential reimbursement for your appointment. Also, the cost and amount of weight lost during a trim varies depending on the length and thickness of your hair. It would be best to discuss this with your stylist during your appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

",0.9,"The email is likely phishing because the sender's email address does not match their name, the email contains random, unrelated phrases, and the appointment date and time requested do not exist (13am on the 31st of February is not a valid date). The email also requests for additional services and asks for personal information, which are common tactics used in phishing attacks. The email's request to address a previous negative salon experience and potential reimbursement also adds a sense of urgency and emotional manipulation to try and convince the recipient to respond."
