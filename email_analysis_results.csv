",0.8,"Based on the context of the conversation, it appears that the sender is trying to book a salon appointment. However, the email does not mention the name of the salon or the sender's name, and the email address appears to be a generic email (emailautomation13@gmail.com). This lack of personalization and specific information raises suspicion and increases the likelihood of this email being phishing. Additionally, the request to book a 'scalp treatment special' and the mention of the sender being an AI Salon Assistant also adds to the suspicion of this email being phishing. A score of 80 is given, indicating a high likelihood of phishing."

",0.95,"Based on the conversation history, there are several red flags that indicate this email is likely phishing. The mention of 'vivisection' and 'harvesting stem cells' for 'dermal rolling' is highly suspicious and not a typical treatment offered by a legitimate clinic. Additionally, the sender's email address is not professional and does not match their name, which further raises suspicion. The suggested appointment times are also suspiciously accommodating, indicating a sense of urgency and pressure to respond quickly. Overall, this email is highly likely to be phishing and we recommend caution before responding or providing any personal information."

",0.1,"Based on the email conversation history, the score is relatively low at 10 as there are no indications or red flags that suggest phishing. The emails are legitimate and appear to be from a real sender and a real business. Additionally, the email explains that the salon does not offer vivisection services, which shows that the email is relevant to the conversation and not trying to solicit personal information.
